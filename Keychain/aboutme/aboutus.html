Our quizzes include one that will tell you          which Disney Princess you are based on your food preferences. Other          quizzes include matching you to a social media platform, are you          smarter than a 5th grader, everyone's favorite family friendly game:          Guess that Object, and a 2000's TV show recommendation. To take the          quizzes click on any one of the images to go to the respective pages          and answer all the questions. You are able to submit without answering          all questions, if you do not know the answer, just know that omitting          answers may change your results. For our storyteller aspect, we found          an API that implements the OpenAI GPT-2 Text Generator, which is an          interesting application of neural networks for text prediction. We          implemented this in our website for users to interact with. The user          is able to enter a short phrase and the "Storyteller" tab generates a          random text which, while occasionally incoherent, makes some sense          given the entered phrase. <br>          <br>          There were no differences from what we had explained in our proposal.          The API almost always takes around 30-45 seconds to load. However, it          may rarely go beyond 60 seconds, in which case the moe.stuy.edu server          will timeout before it is completed. In that case, enter the phrase          again and reload the "Storyteller" tab. <br>          <br>          <br>          <b> Sources </b> <br>          <a href="https://talktotransformer.com/"> Here</a> is a fantastic          website that we based our API aspect off of.

We utilized the range          function and tickmarks, number inputs, etc. The more people we had          testing it, the better the information we got on what the user had          liked and disliked in order to improve the website. It was very          interesting to learn about neural networks, APIs, and GPT-2, and how          to implement these external aspects in our HTML site using python.          Moving forward, we could work on including javascript to enhance the          API experience by loading the generated text little by little, rather          than all at once. <br>          <br>          <br>          <b> Acknowledgements: </b> <br>          <br>          Thank you to Mr. Brooks for blessing us with knowledge for the entire          year, as well as for extending the moe.stuy.edu server timeout time          for our API to function correctly! <br>          Thank you to Hugo Leuchars, Shivali Korgaonkar, and Elio Torres for          being our testers. </span> </div>    </div>    <br>    <br>    <u><u> <span style="color: black;"> </span><br>      </u></u>  </body></html>
