1. Scan the network for open ports
nmap -A -sV 10.10.16.2
See that FTP 21 and SSH 22 are open

2. Connect to FTP and see that lin wrote the task.txt since their name is 
at the bottom

3. Use hydra to brute force the ssh connection
hydra -l lin -P locks.txt -t 4 ssh://10.10.16.2 
Use the locks.txt file for password combinations

4. Since it is asking for root.txt, play around with sudo and sudo -l to 
see privledges. Then use the /bin/tar command along with --help and 
--usage. I used gtfobins to understand the tar command and explored the 
file read and also used basic cd and ls commands to find root.txt
