Nmap HW

3. Scan your home network using nmap. You can run multiple scans with different settings.
Submit a document:
a)
List the commands you used, why you used it, and explain what the
output was. (I don't need your output, only a summary of what you found)
b) How many devices were you able to detect in this manner?
c) How many devices had open ports?
d) What are some things you discovered about your home network / What surprised you when scanning your home network?

a) sudo nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24

nmap —> Specifies the use of the nmap software to scan the network. 
-sn —> Ping scan to quickly identify hosts
IP —> The IP address of my router
0/24 —> Refers to the bits used which accounts for the 255.255.255 since this is 3 bytes. 

b) 8 devices

nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24 | grep "Host is up" | wc

c) 5 with open ports

sudo nmap -Pn -sS 192.168.1.1-184 -vv showed me which ports were open 

d) When I originally tried thinking of how many devices there would be, I had guessed 7. I believe this number could increase if some devices were powered on. I was also surprised by name’s ability to pick up some of the names of these devices, particularly amazon equipment.
