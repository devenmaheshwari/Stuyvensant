# Homework
Stuyvesant Cybersecurity 2022: Final Project

Deven Maheshwari & Jerry Liang

## Instructions
Your homework will be a simple scavenger hunt. You will use our encoder/decoder, as well as information from our presentation, to find clues. You will submit the final flag on Google Classroom.

To begin, clone our repo here: https://github.com/devenmaheshwari/Cyber_Final

Then carefully read the README, which will give you instructions on how to download all dependencies and how to use the makefile.

Now you are ready to begin the homework assignment.

1. cd into the /HW directory.
2. cat `start.txt` to receive your first hint.
3. Follow the hints to the flag!
4. Submit your assignment on Google Classroom as a plaintext file titled `RC4_FIRSTNAME_LASTNAME.txt` with the flag.

If you are ever stuck, feel free to contact Jerry or Deven at jliang21@stuy.edu or dmaheshwari20@stuy.edu. We'd be happy to run you through the assignment.
