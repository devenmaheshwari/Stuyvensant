## Description
Anytime the DOE tries to make a change in how students are taught, whether that is increasing funding or changing teaching techniques, they do not work. The goal of this project would be to analyze and collate the data from these experiments and see what else can be done/what has been successful. It will also include comparisons to other education standards around the country and world, to see how New York City students specifically can benefit.
