K34: Another DB Perspective
2022-04-26

DISCO:
----------
- Schema = outline based on data dictates and dynamic conditions
	- Schema Versioning Pattern to change application but make them 
function symbiotically. Tag schema version, and update queries
- Collection Relationship Diagram (CRD)
	- Linked and embedding based on users and articles, respectively

QCC:
----------
- Data model is a positive feedback loop with improvement
- I like the scalar in child form of CRD's
- What kinds of interview questions cover MongoDB optimization with 
computing pattern or bucket pattern or others?
