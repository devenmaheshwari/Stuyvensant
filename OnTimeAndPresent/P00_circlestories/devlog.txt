Added basic file structure for app routes; added a wrapper file at the root
level that runs the app (circlestories.py).

devenM -- 2021-10-27 21:57
Added wiki design doc for team Sports! which was split up in regrouping.
(design_wiki1.pdf)

devenM -- 2021-10-28 14:00
Added database building python. Configured for user and story databases.
Waiting on routes.py so that information can be processed into database.
(db_maker.py)

christopherL -- 2021-10-28 22:54
Basic refactoring of existing code for style and general consistency. Added a
general guidelines text file that will be added upon in the future for
reference.

christopherL -- 2021-10-28 23:45
Updated design doc: added more fields to the database organization section as
per our new app design (unique ids for everything). Added a database diagram.

christopherL -- 2021-10-29 08:14
Added requirements.txt for dependencies and updated README with launch codes.

naomiN -- 2021-10-29 08:23
Added HTML templates for login and logged in homepage.

christopherL -- 2021-10-29 08:27
Added routing for existing HTML templates.

yusufE -- 2021-10-31 06:41
Added all of my work from 2021-10-27 until now, including:
- StoryDB class to interface with a given SQLite database
- Story DAO that represents a particular row of the stories table
- Tests to ensure that creating new stories & adding blocks works
A lot of the current design is still subject to change.

devenM -- 2021-11-01 08:22
Created login and register html pages. Still tweaking with routing and
connecting to db. (register.html and login.html)

yusufE -- 2021-11-01 08:39
Fixed story & block random ids by storing as hex
Fixed updating values for a Story DAO
Started append.html template for adding to stories

devenM -- 2021-11-01 13:44
Fixed login and register pages to display username, password, and email
prompts. Need to import session to track user cookies
(register.html and login.html)

christopherL -- 2021-11-02 14:14
Connected all of the existing authentication code and set up authentication
routes. Previous db_maker.py is now incorporated into auth.py. We can now
create a new user, log in, stay logged in (with session) and have a different
homepage based on whether the user is logged in or not. Basic validation for
the registration form was implemented (no empty entries, email must be an email,
password and check password must match, username/email must be unique). We
likely should add (1) message flashing to let the user know that registration
worked and (2) PASSWORD HASHING because it's very insecure right now.

christopherL -- 2021-11-02 20:30
Added some basic QA and linting. I chose to use pylint for now, though it's a
little oversensitive so we'll see. Added a .pylintrc and updated
requirements.txt accordingly. In response to some of the linting errors, I did
some basic refactoring as well.

devenM -- 2021-11-03 08:34
Added append and view front end pages. Routed append to main site. Allowing
user to add to most recent block and view the entire creation on another page.
Using story database block ID's to link entire stories. 

christopherL -- 2021-11-03 09:29
Added a method to get a user ID from a username.

devenM -- 2021-11-03 13:13
Edited routes to include append and view html files. Added view html files to
view completed stories and linked homepages and external sites to travel
website. Need to link storydb and routes py to keep track of last_block and
stories. 

christopherL -- 2021-11-04 08:26
Added roster and roles to README.

naomiN -- 2021-11-04 08:33
Added HTML template for creating new stories and edited routes to included new
story page.

yusufE -- 2021-11-04 08:38
Added more StoryDB methods for the relationship between users and stories. 

devenM -- 2021-11-04 08:40
Tested all pages, note that submission on append.html must be addressed as well
as display of username when logged in. Changed routes to work with form
acceptance with authentication.

devenM -- 2021-11-05 08:40
Made new_story design easier to interact with and connected it with storydb. 

yusufE -- 2021-11-06 14:52
Fixed multithreading database bug
Added error.html template
Fixed incorrect endpoint in homepage.html
Fixed methods of `/new_story`

christopherL -- 2021-11-06 22:18
Added routing for all of the story/block database functionality. We can now
create new stories, add to existing stories, and view existing stories, all
with the appropriate permissions settings based on the user that is stored in
the current session. Lots of QA still to do, but we have a minimum viable
product! Also cleaned up the devlog and standardized our team header.

naomiN -- 2021-11-07 21:15
Added an app description to README and to guest landing page

devenM -- 2021-11-08 13:45
Added required inputs for new story to ensure title and content are entered. 
Altered routing for new story to test. 

christopherL -- 2021-11-09 08:06
Set "required" attribute to other required fields in register and login forms.
Removed email field. Updated launch codes.

yusufE -- 2021-11-09 08:39
Added a `base.html` template from which all other templates extend.

devenM -- 2021-11-09 14:01
Added branch to test image upload for stories. Note that delete story method
and add to existing story method need to be added. 

naomiN -- 2021-11-10 08:30
Added image of team flag.

christopherL -- 2021-11-10 08:34
Set team flag as the website favicon.

devenM -- 2021-11-11 23:28
Added image functionality and tested in routes, templates, and storydb.  

christopherL -- 2021-11-12 00:31
Fixed image ordering issue and completed final code cleanup. Checked to ensure
project is in compliance with project guildelines. Added latest design doc.

yusufE -- 2021-11-12 01:54
Updated homepage and view_story to show the usernames of creators & contributors.
For this purpose, a function was added to `Story` to get the list of contibutors.
Another function was added to `auth` to get the username from the user_id.
And yet another function was added to `routes` to get the useful info
from a list of story_id's so that it can be displayed easily by Jinja.
And no, the timestamp on this log is not wrong. I need more sleep.
