DISCO
---------
* To utilize js functions in html code, define the functions separately
and use them between <script> tags. 
* One of the components of the object o is a function itself
* Methods such as 
    * getElementById
    * createElement
    * appendChild
    * getElementsByTagName
* Use math library for min and max



Q/C/C
-----------
* Why does the writing in the script tag replace the words between the <p> tags? 
I believe this behavior is due to the use of innerHTML in the functions. 
* Using helper functions for recursive wrappers makes it easier to display neccary
information on the webpage 
* The green styling is essentially useless other than the one line it is used for 
because it is not used anywhere else
