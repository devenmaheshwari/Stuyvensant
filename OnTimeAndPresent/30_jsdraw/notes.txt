K30 -- canvas based JS drawing
2022-02-14

DISCO:
---------
* Use the MDN reference guide
* Canvas drawing

Q/C/C:
---------
* Be aware of where beginPath is placed because it can draw lines that are not wanted 
* c is different than ctx. The canvas itself vs the rendering object in 2d
* By default, shapes overlap
