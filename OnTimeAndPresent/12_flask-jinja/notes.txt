Q0: What happens if you remove render_template from this line?
You will get an error when you try to call it, because it won't be imported from the flask module.

Q1: Can all of your teammates confidently predict the URL to use to load this page?
We all predicted that it would be http://localhost:5000/my_foist_template

Q2: What is the significance of each argument?
The first argument is the (path &) filename of the template from the templates folder.
The keyword arguments are all values passed to template.

We expect that the title of the webpage will be " fooooo ",
and the body will have 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, & 8 displayed on separate lines.
We also noted that the templates are stored in the "templates" directory,
and we expect that they won't be directly accessible by the user.

We also noticed that the double braces (e.g. `{{ foo }}`) would add the value of foo to the html.
And braces with parenthese (e.g. `{% endfor %}`) signify a command in Jinja's template language.

Coolest discovery: You can do a lot with just the template language!
