* Never allow ROOT @ droplet
* SSH Key or password configuration can be changed later
*     Eventually only use SSH key authentication for security
* Making sure you have the student developer pack
*     Super confusing but you can go to GitHub then sign in and click your profile in the top right. 
      Settings > Billing & Plans
      Check for Github Pro (I think)
*     Another Check
      Go to https://education.github.com/pack/ and sign in
      Click sign up to get an account if not already made. 
      Web dev includes digital ocean but Virtual Event also looks really cool
* Steps to make sure digital ocean credits are there

      Get access code for Digital Ocean 
      Go to digital ocean, my account
      Click the ellipses (...) > Manage billing 
      Scroll down and enter the promo code. 
      Congrats, you shouldn't be paying anymore!
* Sudo commands
*     $su means "switch user" 
      $sudo apt install --> Uses admin privledges
* Creating Droplets
*     Go to Digital Ocean
      Droplets under "Manage." Click create
      Follow Ubuntu --> Basic Plan shared CPU - $5/mo --> New York datacenter region --> SSH Key authentication --> No backups
