DISCO:
---------
* Keep in mind where the <script> tag is placed within the HTML frontend. Should be placed at the end of the code. 
* Probably a better way to do this but we used global variables for each function and changed their values each time 
a function ran in order to show the sequence of values
* Math library in js comes in handy with generating random values
* Incrementing works the same as in java



Q/C/C:
---------
* JS is not compiled all together like Java is so order of function placement matters
* Using getElementByID and EventListener together makes the code easier to raed
* Errors
    * "Too much recursion" - look at how functions are being called. Make sure a base case is present
    * "Null values" - examine variable assignments and script tag
* Use ID not name for button delineation
