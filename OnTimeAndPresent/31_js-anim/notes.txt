K31 -- canvas based JS animation
2022-02-15

DISCO:
-------
* List of available colors on mdn for fillStyle


Q/C/C:
-------
* Why do the cancelAnimationFrame and requestAnimationFrame need to be part of this file? If animation is just a series of repeated drawing and clearing, can't the js file just draw a circle then wait then clear and repeat? 
* Use consolelog like python print statements to see what is running
